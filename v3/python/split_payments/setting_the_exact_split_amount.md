## Setting the exact split amount

The default implementation for subaccounts, expects that you pass the value of the total amount to be charged from the customer as a commission and Flutterwave calculates the amount to be sent to the subaccount based on the commission you set up. In a case where it's more than one subaccount, we ask that you pass a split ratio which divides the funds between the subaccounts based on the ratios specified.

Should you want to specify a fixed amount to be passed to a subaccount, we created a payment flow that allows you pass the exact amount you want a customer's subaccount to receive. Here's how it works:

```python

# One Subaccount

from rave_python
import Rave, Misc, RaveExceptions

rave = Rave("<YOUR PUBLIC KEY>", "<YOUR SECRET KEY>", usingEnv = False)

payload = {
  "amount": "10000",
  "country": "NG",
  "currency": "NGN",
  "payment_type": "account",
  "IP": "355426087298442",

  }],

  "meta": [{
    "metaname": "storeID",

  }]
}

try:
res = rave.Account.charge(payload)
if res["authUrl"]:
  print(res["authUrl"])

elif res["validationRequired"]:
  rave.Account.validate(res["flwRef"], "12345")

res = rave.Account.verify(res["txRef"])
print(res)

**Handling the exact amount your subaccounts receive**

As shown in the code sample above, please pass the amount you want your subaccount to get in the `subaccounts` array as `transaction_charge: "{amount}"` and pass the flag that indicates you are specifying the amount you expect the subaccount to receive by adding `transaction_charge_type: "flat_subaccount"`
    
***PS: We expect that before you specify the amount, you have calculated the transaction processing fee and commission and it has been deducted from the amount specified.***

Thus the subaccounts would get the value you specified in the  `transaction_charge` property after any transaction.

## Parameters

| Parameter 	| Required 	| Description 	|
|---------------------------	|------------------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `id` 	| True <br> (`String`) 	|This is the ID of the subaccount, you can get it from your dashboard e.g. `RS_B00A5EAB4B6A988A454DEADC2F6262BC` 	|
| `meta` 	| True <br> (`String`) 	| This is the data that describes and gives information about the subaccount 	|
| `transaction_split_ratio` 	|  False <br> (`String`) 	| This is the ratio value representing the share of the amount you intend to give a subaccount. This is only needed when: <br> 1. You are splitting between more than one subaccount. <br>  2. You are not passing the [exact amount](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/split-payment#section-passing-the-exact-amount-you-want-a-subaccount-to-receive) you expect the subaccount to get. 	|
| `transaction_charge_type` 	| False <br> (`String`) 	| This represents the type of commission you would like to charge. If you would like to charge a flat fee pass the value as `flat`. If you would like to charge a fee based on a percentage basis, pass the value as `percentage`. When you pass this you override the type set as commission when the subaccount was created. <br> If you want to pass the [exact amount](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/split-payment#section-passing-the-exact-amount-you-want-a-subaccount-to-receive) you expect a subaccount to get, pass the value as `flat_subaccount` 	|
| `transaction_charge` 	| False <br> (`String`) 	| The flat or percentage value to charge as commission on the transaction. When you pass this, you override the values set as commission when the subaccount was created. 	|

**Using percentages as transaction charges**

When setting up your `transaction_charge_type` value as a percentage, you would need to add the percentage value i.e. `transaction_charge` in decimal. e.g. `transaction_charge: 0.09` is equal to a `9%` commission on transactions.
