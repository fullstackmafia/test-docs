## Purchase a bill service

You can purchase a single bill service such as airtime, DStv, etc through the  `fly_buy`  service. When you pass this in your  `POST`  request, also pass in a service payload as well. Below is a code sample depicting how you can do this:

```python

    import requests
    
    url = "https://api.ravepay.co/v2/services/confluence"
    
    querystring = {
      "secret_key": "YOUR SECRET KEY",
      "service": "fly_buy",
      "service_method": "post",
      "service_version": "v1",
      "service_channel": "rave",
      "service_payload": {
        "Country": "NG",
        "CustomerId": "+23490803840303",
        "Reference": "9300049404444",
        "Amount": 500,
        "RecurringType": 0,
        "IsAirtime": true,
        "BillerName": "AIRTIME"
      }
    }
    
    headers = {
      'content-type': 'application/json'
    }
    try:
    res = requests.request("POST", url, headers = headers, params = querystring)
    print(res.text)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
      print(e)

```

Below is an example of the response you'll get should your request be successful:

```python

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "SERVICE-RESPONSE",
  "data": {
    "MobileNumber": "+2349082930030",
    "Amount": 500,
    "Network": "9MOBILE",
    "TransactionReference": "CF-FLYAPI-20190822093219730987",
    "PaymentReference": "BPUSSD15665095405052159977",
    "BatchReference": null,
    "ExtraData": null,
    "Status": "success",
    "Message": "Bill Payment was completed successfully",
    "Reference": null
  }
}
```

Two scenarios could lead to an error message being returned:

 An invalid customer ID: 

```python

    {
      "Status": "fail",
      "Message": "Invalid customer id",
      "Code": "903",
      "CustomerReference": "+2339026420185"
    }

```

Or an invalid phone number:

```python

{
  "Status": "fail",
  "Message": "Invalid Phone",
  "Code": "905",
  "CustomerReference": "+190830030"
}
```

## Purchasing a bill service in bulk

You may want to purchase certain services in bulk. Rave enables this via the  `fly_buy_bulk`  service. This is handy for merchants who who may want to provide value to multiple customers at once. Here's a code snippet depicting how this is done:

```python

    import requests
    
    url = "https://api.ravepay.co/v2/services/confluence"
    
    querystring = {
            "secret_key": "YOUR SECRET KEY",
            "service": "fly_buy_bulk",
            "service_method": "post",
            "service_version": "v1",
            "service_channel": "rave",
            "service_payload": {
                "BatchReference": "batch-rave-150928302799933922",
                "CallBackUrl": "https://rave-webhook.herokuapp.com/newregistration",
                "Requests": [{
                        "Country": "NG",
                        "CustomerId": "+23490803840303",
                        "Amount": 500,
                        "RecurringType": 0,
                        "IsAirtime": true,
                        "BillerName": "AIRTIME",
                        "Reference": "9300049404444"
                    },
                    {
                        "Country": "GH",
                        "CustomerId": "+233276081163",
                        "Amount": 10,
                        "RecurringType": 0,
                        "IsAirtime": true,
                        "BillerName": "AIRTIME",
                        "Reference": "9300049405555"
                    },
                    {
                        "Country": "US",
                        "CustomerId": "+190830030",
                        "Amount": 20,
                        "RecurringType": 0,
                        "IsAirtime": true,
                        "BillerName": "AIRTIME",
                        "Reference": "9300049406666"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    
    headers = {
      'content-type': 'application/json'
    }
    try:
    res = requests.request("POST", url, headers = headers, params = querystring)
    print(res.text)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
      print(e)

```

Below is a sample response:

```python

    {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "SERVICE-RESPONSE",
        "data": {
            "MobileNumber": null,
            "Amount": 0,
            "Network": null,
            "TransactionReference": null,
            "PaymentReference": null,
            "BatchReference": "CF-BATCH-FLY-API-201808241206220204935114",
            "Status": "success",
            "Message": "Bill Payment was queued for processing",
            "Reference": null
        }
    }

```

Two scenarios could lead to an error message being returned:

 An invalid customer ID: 

```python

    {
      "Status": "fail",
      "Message": "Invalid customer id",
      "Code": "903",
      "CustomerReference": "+2339026420185"
    }

```

    {
      "Status": "fail",
      "Message": "Invalid Phone",
      "Code": "905",
      "CustomerReference": "+190830030"
    }


```
