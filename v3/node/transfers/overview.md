With Rave, you can initiate single and bulk transfers to bank accounts and mobile money accounts across Africa. Make transfers to vendors, partners or marketplace merchants all from your rave profile or via API. 

You can either use the money you have earned as income i.e. Money collected from your customer's using rave or fund your balance on rave to initiate transfers to bank accounts & mobile money wallets in:

- `Nigeria` 
- `United States`
- `Ghana`  
- `Kenya` 
- `Uganda` 
- `Tanzania`
- `Rwanda`
- `South Africa`
- `Zambia`
- `Ivory Coast`

Transfers can be done from the dashboard or using our [APIs](https://flutterwavedevelopers.readme.io/v2.0/reference#how-transfers-work). We would describe the process to complete a transfer on your rave dashboard below.


** NOTES

<div class="notes">
When a transfer is initiated, it comes with a status NEW this means the transfer has been queued for processing, and you would need to use the reference you passed to call the <a href="#">Fetch a Transfer</a> endpoint to retrieve the updated status of the transfer.
